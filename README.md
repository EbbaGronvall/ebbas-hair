# Ebba's Hair

Ebba's Hair is a website for a hair salon called "Ebba's Hair". It has a page where the user can read more about the stylists who are available for bookings and the different services they offer. There user is also able to find information about where the salon is located, their phonenumber and their email-address. The user is also able to book an appointment online.

Ebba's Hair is not a real salon so the contact information and the stylists are fictional and just for the sake of this website.

## The website on different screensizes

Since I have used Bootstrap container, rows and collumns, an expandable navbar and % width on images the website adapts beautifully to different screensizes.

## The Color Scheme

For this project I choose five shades of a brownish grey color that I used across the whole website.

## The Font

I used the Google Font "Comfortaa" for all the text found on the website. It suited my vision best.
